# Agentic-AI-employee-onboarding-service
An Agentic AI runs new employee onboarding end-to-end. Through a Streamlit chat, it gathers missing details, generates a unique employee ID and office email, assigns a free cubicle and OS-matched laptop, and writes address/phone/other data to Postgres. It plans steps, calls tools, builds schema, and safely generates SQL.
